    "Why cloud storage?\n",
    "1. **Availability:** Users can access their files from any devices, anywhere, anytime.\n",
    "2. **Durability and Reliability:** Cloud storage ensures that users never lose their data by storing their data on different geographically located servers.\n",
    "3. **Scalability:** Users will never have to worry about running out of storage space, as long as they are ready to pay for it.\n",

    "Wht do we want to achieve from a cloud storage system?\n",
    "1. Users should be able to upload/download files from any devices\n",
    "2. Users should be aable to share files and folders with other users\n",
    "3. The service should support large files\n",
    "4. The service should allow syncing of files between devices. Updating a file on a device should get synchronized on all other devices.\n",
    "5. ACID-ity on all file operations should be enforced.\n",
    "6. The service should support offline editing, and as soon as users come online, all changes synced.\n",
    "7. The service should support snapshotting of data, so that users can go back to previous versions of it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Considerations\n",
    "- We should expect large read and write volumes, with the read/write ratio being about the same.\n",
    "- Files must be stored in small chunks. This has a lot of benefits, such as if a user fails to upload a file, then only the failing chunk will be retried instead of the entire file.\n",
    "- We can reduce on data exchange by transferring updated chunks only. And, for small changes, clients can intelligently upload the diffs instead of the whole chunk\n",
    "- The system can remove duplicate chunks, to save storage space and bandwidth.\n",
    "- We can prevent lots of round trips to the server if clients keep a local copy of metadata (file name, size etc)"
