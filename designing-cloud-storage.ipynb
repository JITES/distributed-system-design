    "2. **Durability and Reliability:** Cloud storage ensures that users never lose their data by storing their data on different geographically located servers.\n",

    "5. ACID-ity on all file operations should be enforced.\n",
    "6. The service should support offline editing, and as soon as users come online, all changes synced.\n",
    "7. The service should support snapshotting of data, so that users can go back to previous versions of it"
