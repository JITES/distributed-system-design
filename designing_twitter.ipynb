    "# Designing Twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter is an online social networking service where users post and read short 140-character messages called \"tweets\". Registered Users can post and read tweets, but those not registered can only read them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Requirements and System Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "1. Users should be able to post new tweets.\n",
    "2. A user should be able to follow other users.\n",
    "3. Users should be able to mark tweets as favorites.\n",
    "4. Tweets can contain photos and videos.\n",
    "5. A user should have a timeline consting of top tweets from all the people the user follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-functional Requirements\n",
    "1. Our service needs to be highly available.\n",
    "2. Acceptance latency of the sytstem is 200ms for timeline generation.\n",
    "3. Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability); if user doesn't see a tweet for a while, it should be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended Requirements\n",
    "1. Searching tweets.\n",
    "2. Replying to a tweet.\n",
    "3. Trending topics - current hot topics.\n",
    "4. Tagging other users.\n",
    "5. Tweet notification.\n",
    "6. Suggestions on who to follow."

    "## Capacity Estimation and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have 1 billion users, with 200 million daily active users (DAU). \n",
    "Also assume we have 100 million new tweets every day, and on average each user follows 200 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many favorites per day?** If on average, each user favorites 5 tweets per day, we have:\n",
    "```\n",
    "200M users * 5 => 1 billion favorites.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many total tweet-views?** Let's assume on average a user visits their timeline twice a day and visits 5 other people's pages. On each page if a user sees 20 tweets, then the no. of views our system will generate is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "200M DAU * ((2 + 5) * 20 tweets) => 28B/day\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storage Estimates\n",
    "Let's say each tweet has 140 characters and we need two bytes to store a character without compression. Assume we need 30 bytes to store metadata with each tweet (like ID, timestamps, etc.). Total storage we would need is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "100M new daily tweets * ((140 * 2) + 30) bytes => ~28 GB/day\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all tweets will have media, let's assume that on average every fifth tweet has a photo and every tenth a video. Let's also assume on average, a photo = 0.5MB and a video = 5MB. This will lead us to have:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    (100M/5 photos * 0.5MB) + (100M/10 videos * 5MB) ~= 60 TB/day\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bandwidth Estimates\n",
    "Since total ingress is 60TB per day, then it will translate to: \n",
    "```\n",
    "60TB / (24 * 60 * 60) ~= 690 MB/sec\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remember we have 28 billion tweets views in a day. We must show the photo of every tweet, but let's assume that the users watch every 3rd video they see in their timeline. So, total egress will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      (28Billion * 280 bytes) / 86400 of text ==> 93MB/s\n",
    "    + (28Billion/5 * 0.5MB) /  86400 of photos ==> ~32GB/s\n",
    "    + (28Billion/10/3 * 5MB) / 86400 of videos ==> ~54GB/s\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Total ~= 85GB/sec\n",

    "## 4. High Level System Design\n",
    "We need a system that can efficiently store all the new tweets, \n",
    "i.e\n",
    "- store `100M/86400sec => 1150 tweets per second` \n",
    "- and read `28billion/86400s => 325,000 tweets per second`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clears that from the requirements, the system will be **read-heavy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level:\n",
    "- we need multiple application servers to serve all these requests with load balancers in front of them for traffic distribution. \n",
    "- On the backend, we need an efficent datastore that will store all the new tweets and can support huge read numbers. \n",
    "- We also need file storage to store photos and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "This traffic will be distributed unevenly throughout the day, though, at peak time we expect at leas a few thousand write requests and around 1M read requests per second. \n",
    "**We should keep this in mind while designing the architecture of our system.**\n",

    "## 6. Data Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a huge number of tweets every day. We need to distribute our data onto multiple machines such that reads/writes are efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharding based on UserID\n",
    "We can try storing a user's data on one server. While storing:\n",
    "- Pass a UserID to our hash function that will map the user to a DB server where we'll store all of their data. (tweets, favorites, follows, etc.)\n",
    "- While querying for their data, we can ask the hash function where to find it and read it from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Issues:\n",
    "1. What if a user becomes hot? There will be lots of queries on the server holding that user. This high load will affect the service's performance.\n",
    "2. Over time, some users will have more data compared to others. Maintaining a uniform distribution of growing data is quite difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharding based on TweetID\n",
    "- Hash function maps each TweetID to a random server where we store that tweet.\n",
    "- Searching a tweet will query all servers, and each server will return a set of tweets.\n",
    "- A centralized server will aggregate the results to return them to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To generate a user's timeline:**\n",
    "1. App server will find all the people the user follows.\n",
    "2. App server will send a query to all DB servers to find tweets from these people.\n",
    "3. Each DB server will find tweets for each user, sort them by recency and return top tweets.\n",
    "4. App server will merge all results and sort them again to return the top results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solves the problem of hot users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues with this approach:\n",
    "- We have to query all DB partitions to find tweets for a user, leading to higher latencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We can improve the performance by caching hot tweets in front of the DB servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharding based on Tweet creation time\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing tweets based on creation timestamp will help us to fetch all top tweets quickly and we only have to query a very small set of database servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues:\n",
    "- Traffic load won't be distributed. e.g when writing, all new tweets will be going to one DB server, and remaining DB servers sit idle. When reading, a database server holding the latest data will have high load as compared to servers holding old data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharding by TweetID + Tweet creation time\n",
    "Each tweetID should be universally unique and contain a timestamp.\n",
    "We can use epoch time for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "First part of TweetID will be a timestamp, second part an auto-incrementing number. We can then figure out the shard number from this TweetId and store it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could be the size of our TweetID?\n",
    "If our epoch time started today, the number of bits we need to store the number of seconds for the next 50 years:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number of seconds for the next 50 years:\n",
    "    86400 sec/day * 365 days * 50 years ==> 1.6 billion seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/twitter_epoch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We would need 31 bits to store the epoch time.\n",
    "```\n",
    "2 ^ 31 ==> ~ 2 billion seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since on average we expect 1150 new tweets every second i.e \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   (100M daily / 86400 seconds) ==> 1150 tweets/sec\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "we can allocate 17 bits to store auto incremented sequence. This makes our tweetID 48 bits long. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every second, we can store 2^17(130k) new tweets. \n",
    "We can reset our auto incrementing sequence every second. For fault tolerance and better performance, we can have two DB servers to generate auto-incrementing keys; one odd numbers and one even numbered keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume our current epoch seconds begins now, TweetIDs will look like this:"

    "#### Intelligent caching?\n",
    "If we go with the 80-20 rule, 20% of tweets generating 80% of read traffic, meaning certain tweets are so popular that a majority of people read them. Therefore, we can try to cache 20% of daily read volume from each shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caching latest data?\n",
    "Let's say if 80% of our users see tweets from the last 3 days only, we can cache all tweets from past 3 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are getting 100M tweets  or 30GB of new data every day(without photos or videos). If we want to store all the tweets from last 3 days, we will need 100GB of memory. This data can easily fit into one cache server, but we should replicate it onto multiple servers to distribute all the read traffic to reduce the load on cache servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we are generating a user's timeline, we can ask the cache servers if they have all the recent tweets for that user, If yes, we can simply return all the data from the cache.

    "- Key would be `OwnerID` and value would be a doubly linked list containing all tweets from that user in the past 3 days.\n",

    "3. Between Aggregation servers and Cache servers\n",
